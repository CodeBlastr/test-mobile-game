# GuessNumberGame

This repository contains a minimal "Guess Which Number I'm Thinking Of?" game for iOS built with SwiftUI.

## Game Play
1. The app chooses a random number between 1 and 100.
2. Enter your guess in the text field.
3. Tap **Submit Guess** to see how close you were and which number was chosen.

## Building the App
1. Open Xcode and create a new "App" project (using Swift and SwiftUI).
2. Replace the default `ContentView.swift` and `<YourAppName>App.swift` files with the files in the `GuessNumberGame` folder.
3. Build and run the project on the iPhone simulator or a physical device.
